# Hello Docker

Simple way to test if a student's local Docker setup is working correctly.

## Local Development

You will need to install the Javascript dependencies with:

```shell
$ npm install
```

You can then start the local development server with:

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

Then you need to build the Tailwind CSS with:

```shell
$ npm run build:css
```
